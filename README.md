# Space-Alchemy
In this game, you can capture fungus creatures throughout different dimensions to help a witch brew up some potions. Jump around on platforms in every dimension using the arrow keys and teleport to other dimensions via magical orbs. The witch will also reward you with a potion at the end of the game depending on how much supplies you bring back.
